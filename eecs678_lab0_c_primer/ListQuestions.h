/*
 * Problem: Determine if a linked list has a cycle
 *
 * Description:
 * Given the head of a linked list, determine if the list contains a cycle. A cycle occurs if a node can be
 * reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, 'pos' is used to denote the index
 * of the node that the tail's next pointer is connected to, indicating a cycle. Note that 'pos' is not
 * accessible or passed as a parameter; it's only used for problem understanding and explanation.
 *
 * Task:
 * Implement a function to check if the given linked list has a cycle. The function should return 'true' if a
 * cycle is present and 'false' otherwise.
 *
 * Prototype:
 * bool hasCycle(struct Node *head);

/*
 * Problem: Merge Two Sorted Lists
 *
 * Description:
 * You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists, list1 and list2. Your task is to merge these two
 * lists into one single sorted list. The merged list should be constructed by splicing together the nodes
 * of the first two lists without creating new nodes, but by rearranging the nodes from the given lists.
 *
 * Task:
 * Implement a function that merges two sorted linked lists and returns the head of the newly merged sorted
 * linked list.
 *
 * Prototype:
 * struct Node* mergeTwoLists(struct Node* list1, struct Node* list2);
 *
 * Note:
 * Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
